# InfluenceMax
This repository contains efficient implementations for computing the influence maximization on large graphs using distinct data structures. The details of the implementations are described in the following paper:

Diana Popova, Akshay Khot, Alex Thomo: Data Structures for Efficient Computation of Influence Maximization and Influence Estimation. Accepted by EDBT/ICDT 2018 Joint Conference (Vienna, March 26-29, 2018).

There are three implementations of the algorithm in:

C. Borgs, M. Brautbar, J. Chayes, and B. Lucier. Maximizing social influence
in nearly optimal time. In SODA, pages 946â€“957, 2014.

using the WebGraph compression in:

P. Boldi and S. Vigna. The webgraph framework I: compression techniques. WWW'04. 

All implementations are coded in Java 8.
# IM_list
Data structure used in this implementation is list of lists (two-dimensional list).
# IM_flat
Data structure used in this implementation is one-dimensional array (flat array).
# IM_flat_compr
Data structures used in this implementation are one-dimensional array (flat array) and custom-compressed flat array.
# Getting Started
Download and install Webgraph framework from http://webgraph.di.unimi.it.

Download a dataset from http://law.di.unimi.it/datasets.php. Our programs use transpose (inverse) graphs, 
which have "-t" after the name. For example, cnr-2000-t.graph. 

The graph should not have self-loops. To eliminate the self-loops, download our custom program SelfLoopRemover.

Download IM_list.java, IM_flat.java, and/or IM_flat_compr.java from this project, to test different data structures.
# Running the tests
Compile the programs using Webgraph library, for example:

```

javac -cp "lib/*" -d bin src/*.java

```

Run the program with parameters of your choice. For example:

```

java -Xmx16g -cp "../lib/*":"../bin" IM_flat cnr-2000-t 0.1 32 10

```

IM_flat is the program to run; cnr-2000-t is the basename for the graph; 0.1 is p, the probability of edge existence;
32 is the value of beta (coefficient for calculating the weight of hypergraph); and 10 is k, the number of seeds.
